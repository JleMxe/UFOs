    The user simply enters the appropriate data in the search fields on the left side of the page. The page is set to update the filtered data on the right with each entry. To reset the filter criteria the user can either reload the page or manually clear each field.

# Summary
    To summarize, while the requested search parameters were added, the ability to filter the data in a meaningful way is still limited. Drawbacks to the existing search/filter methodology are listed below.

    - There is only a single date selectable
    - There is only a single state selectable
    - Search entries must be entered in all lowercase letters

    The following list are suggestion to significantly improve the search/filtering experience.

    - Allow a date range to be entered
    - Instead of user entry, use drop down lists that pull from the filtered data set
    - Allow for multiple state selections so that a region can be analyze
